sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Because it takes much less time to execute an array that has been sorted than the other two,
                  this is the situation that occurs when Bubble Sort executes an already sorted array.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Because this algorithm takes a short time whether it is reversed, random, or sorted.
                  And the time it takes to exetute the reversed file or random file is significantly less than the other two algorithms.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: This algorithm takes about the same amount of time in the three cases.
                  This is because the time complexity of Selection Sort is O(n2) in either case.

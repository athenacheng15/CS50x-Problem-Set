QUESTION:
Spotify Wrapped is a feature presenting Spotify users’ 100 most played songs from the past year. 
In 2021, Spotify Wrapped calculated an “Audio Aura” for each user, 
a “reading of [their] two most prominent moods as dictated by [their] top songs and artists of the year.” 
Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year. 
In answers.txt, reflect on the following questions:

1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
2. Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?


ANSWER:
I'll average the energy, valence, and danceability of the top 100 songs for that listener.
According to the above three values, they respectively represent six values ​​such as positivity and laziness, happiness and sadness, vitality and calmness.
Then take the two values ​​farthest from the middle value as representatives of the listener's audio aura.

Better ways:
Because the average eliminates the influence of extreme values, if a listener plays the same song all the time,
it means that the current emotion at that time is very strong.
Therefore, I propose multiplying the energy, valence, and danceability by the number of plays for each song before averaging them.
This way, the audio aura can better reflect the listener’s most prominent emotional characteristics.
